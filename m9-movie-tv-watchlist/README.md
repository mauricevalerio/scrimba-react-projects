## Reflection
Rebuilt from scratch the Module 9: APIs solo project from Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Bootcamp that lasted for a week and was originally written using JavaScript. The goal of this project was to familiarize myself more on the latest React Router V6 and practice muscle memory with basic React. Also learned a new CSS framework Tailwind CSS and familiarized myself with the documentation.

My challenges were mainly the UI/UX design, layout, and the route hierarchy for React Router. Have to reference some Figma designs but ultimately ended up referencing the design of Disney Plus.

Used Vite for bundling the code and also used different tools from npm including 
the latest `React Router V6`, `React Carousel`, `React Infinite Scroll`, and `Framer Motion`.

## Future Improvements
  - Replace the horizontal scrollbar with horizontal scrolling with arrows instead.
  - Light and dark mode
  - User login functionality
