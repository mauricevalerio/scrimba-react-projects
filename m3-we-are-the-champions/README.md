## Reflection
A solo project under Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path Module 3: Making Websites Interactive. Learned Firebase such as the following:
 - Basic setup code to connect to Firebase
 - Firebase just as any other database handles the automatic creation of unique IDs
 - `ref` is used to point to a specific database you created on Firebase
 - `onValue` callback function runs everytime there is a change in the database
 - `push` method creates a record on the firebase database
 - `remove` methods deletes a record on the firebase database

## Future Improvements
  - Desktop version
