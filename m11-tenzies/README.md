## Reflection
A guided project under Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path Module 11: React Basics and added the following features on top of the guided project:
- Applied Responsive Design.
- Disables die click events if user has won, game is paused, or if leaderboard modal is open.
- Tracks number of rolls and time to finish the game.
- Ability to pause and resume game.
- Added leaderboards.
- Save leaderboards on local storage.
- Added random usernames as placeholders for leaderboards.
- Can sort leaderboards in ascending/descending order for number of rolls and time.

This was made to practice hands on for React and the concepts of props, useState and useEffect hooks. 

## Future Improvements
  - Stop the timer on initial game load.
