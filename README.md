## Reflection
A solo project under Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path Module 11: React Basics and added the following features on top of the basic requirements of the project:
- Applied Responsive Design.
- Added the option to choose difficulty, number of questions, and category.
- Flagged each question whether if it is correct, wrong, or did not answer for UX design.

This was made to practice hands on for React and the concepts of props, useState and useEffect hooks. 

## Future Improvements
  - Add loading animations.
